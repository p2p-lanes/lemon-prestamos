# Security Fixes & Recommendations

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical fixes implemented, pending redeployment

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerability Fixed: Credit Limit Gaming

### The Problem

The original implementation allowed users to game the credit limit system:

1. Borrow 5 USDT → Repay immediately → Limit increases to 6 USDT
2. Borrow 6 USDT → Repay immediately → Limit increases to 7.2 USDT
3. Repeat until credit limit is very high
4. Borrow maximum amount and default

**Impact**: Users could rapidly inflate their credit limits and then default on large loans.

### The Fix

**Added `MIN_LOAN_DURATION = 7 days`**

```solidity
// Check: Minimum loan duration passed (prevents gaming)
uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.timestamp;
require(
    timeElapsed >= MIN_LOAN_DURATION,
    "Loan must be active for at least 7 days"
);
```

Now users must keep loans active for at least 7 days before repaying, preventing rapid credit limit cycling.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Change: Default Threshold

### Changed

```solidity
// OLD
uint256 public constant DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 90 days;

// NEW
uint256 public constant DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 30 days;
```

**Reasoning**: Since loans are designed for 30-day terms, defaults should trigger at 30 days, not 90.

---

## 🔒 Additional Security Enhancement

### Prevent Borrowing with Defaulted Loans

```solidity
// Check: No defaulted loan
require(!existingLoan.isDefaulted, "Cannot borrow with defaulted loan");
```

Users cannot take out new loans while they have an unpaid defaulted loan.

## 📋 Summary of Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `INITIAL_CREDIT_LIMIT` | 5 USDT | Starting limit for new users |
| `CREDIT_INCREASE_FACTOR` | 120% | Increase after successful repayment |
| `BASE_APR` | 10% | Interest rate for on-time repayment |
| `PUNITIVE_APR` | 20% | Interest rate after loan duration |
| `LOAN_DURATION` | 30 days | Expected loan term |
| `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` | 30 days | When loans can be marked as defaulted |
| `MIN_LOAN_DURATION` | **7 days** | **NEW** - Minimum time before repayment |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Redeploy contract** with these security fixes
2. **Update `.env`** with new vault address
3. **Re-test all flows** with 7-day minimum enforced
4. **Update documentation** with new security features

### Testing Required

- [ ] Test that repayment fails before 7 days
- [ ] Test that repayment succeeds after 7 days
- [ ] Test that borrowing fails with defaulted loan
- [ ] Test automatic default at 30 days (requires time manipulation or live wait)

## 💡 Future Considerations

### Contract Upgradeability

**Current**: Contract is immutable (cannot be upgraded)

**Options**:
1. **Keep immutable** (recommended for MVP)
   - ✅ More secure and trustworthy
   - ✅ Simpler architecture
   - ❌ Requires redeployment for fixes
   - ❌ Need to migrate funds to new contract

2. **Make upgradeable** (UUPS pattern)
   - ✅ Can fix bugs without redeployment
   - ✅ Can add features over time
   - ❌ More complex architecture
   - ❌ Adds upgrade risk
   - ❌ Requires proxy pattern

**Recommendation**: Keep immutable for MVP. For production, consider upgradeability if you expect frequent updates.

## 🔐 Additional Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Professional Audit**
   - Get smart contract security audit before mainnet
   - Typical cost: $10k-50k depending on complexity

2. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Offer rewards for finding vulnerabilities
   - Platform: Code4rena, Immunefi, or HackerOne

3. **Time Locks**
   - Add time delay for admin functions
   - Gives users time to exit if owner acts maliciously

4. **Multi-Sig Ownership**
   - Use Gnosis Safe for owner address
   - Require 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 signatures for admin actions

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Consider max borrows per day per user
   - Prevent flash loan attacks

6. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Automatic pause if utilization > 95%
   - Automatic pause if defaults spike

## 📊 Risk Analysis

### Low Risk (Mitigated)
- ✅ Credit limit gaming → Fixed with MIN_LOAN_DURATION
- ✅ Default tracking → Implemented with proper accounting
- ✅ Reentrancy → Protected with ReentrancyGuard
- ✅ Integer overflow → Using Solidity 0.8.x (built-in checks)

### Medium Risk (Acceptable for MVP)
- ⚠️ ERC4626 deposit function issues → Using direct transfers workaround
- ⚠️ No contract upgradeability → Acceptable for testnet
- ⚠️ No automated default marking → Manual admin action required

### Areas for Improvement
- 📝 Add automated default detection
- 📝 Implement proper ERC4626 deposit
- 📝 Add governance mechanism for parameter updates
- 📝 Implement insurance fund for defaults
- 📝 Add credit scoring based on repayment history

## 🎯 Deployment Checklist

Before mainnet deployment:

- [ ] Security fixes deployed and tested
- [ ] Professional audit completed
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet configured
- [ ] Insurance/reserve fund established
- [ ] Bug bounty program launched
- [ ] Frontend security review
- [ ] Legal compliance review
- [ ] User agreement and terms drafted

---

**Remember**: These are test contracts on Base Sepolia. Do NOT deploy to mainnet without professional security audit.
